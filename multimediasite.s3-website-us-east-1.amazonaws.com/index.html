  <div class="section column" style="margin-top:50px;">
    <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ouda at first said nothing.  She passed
      her hand across her forehead, and reflected a few moments.  Then, in her
      sweet, soft voice, she said: "What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?"</p>

      <p>"It is very simple," responded the gentleman.  "Go on to Europe."</p>

      <p>"But I cannot intrude&mdash;"</p>

      <p>"You do not intrude, nor do you in the least embarrass my project.
      Passepartout!"</p>

      <p>"Monsieur."</p>

      <p>"Go to the Carnatic, and engage three cabins."</p>

      <p>Passepartout, delighted that the young woman, who was very gracious to
      him, was going to continue the journey with them, went off at a brisk gait
      to obey his master's order.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by
      the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of
      the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port.
      The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated
      by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite
      coast.  Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade,
      and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its
      depot at the former place.  Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic cathedral,
      a government house, macadamised streets, give to Hong Kong the appearance
      of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the
      antipodes.</p>

      <p>Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the
      Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes
      of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans who
      passed to and fro in the streets.  Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike
      Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere
      the evidence of English supremacy.  At the Victoria port he found a
      confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French, American, and
      Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas,
      tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres.
      Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very
      old and were dressed in yellow.  On going into a barber's to get shaved he
      learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old, at
      which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is the Imperial colour.
      Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, thought this very funny.</p>

      <p>On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic, he was
      not astonished to find Fix walking up and down.  The detective seemed very
      much disturbed and disappointed.</p>
